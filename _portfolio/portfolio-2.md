In this project I implemened [Cycle-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593) paper for domain adaptation. Implemented adversarial training with cyclic consistency loss for unpaired data mappings.
The primary objective is to demonstrate the capability of CycleGAN to learn a mapping between two domains without the need for paired training data. You can find the implementation and other details [here](https://github.com/jasmeetsingh-028/Domain-Adaptation-using-Cycle-GAN-)
