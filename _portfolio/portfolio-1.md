In this project, I implemented a [denoising diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239) from scratch, leveraging a UNet-based architecture. Denoising Diffusion Models are a powerful class of generative models that transform data distributions into noise distributions and learn to reverse this process to generate new data. My detailed guide covers the theoretical background, training methodology, and sampling process. Through this implementation, I explore how these models function by gradually adding noise to images and then training a network to effectively remove the noise and generate high-quality images.
