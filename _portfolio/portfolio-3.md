In this project, I built a [Neural Style Transfer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ailm/Neural-Style-Transfer-GPU) application, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. The app allows users to upload a content image and a style image to generate a stylized output using a VGG-19-based model.  

The model optimizes the style and content losses through gradient descent, progressively transforming the content image to match the artistic style. Users can customize the number of steps, influencing the level of style transfer detail.  

You can try the app [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ailm/Neural-Style-Transfer-GPU) and check out the code [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ailm/Neural-Style-Transfer-GPU/tree/main).
