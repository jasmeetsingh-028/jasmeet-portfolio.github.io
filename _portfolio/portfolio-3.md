In this project I implemened [Pix2Pix (Image to Image translation using Conditional GAN)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix) to take facade images as input and generate corresponding realistic building images as output. It leverages the power of conditional GANs, where a generator and discriminator are trained together to improve the quality of generated images.. You can find the implementation and other details [here](https://github.com/jasmeetsingh-028/Pix2Pix-Conditional-GAN).
