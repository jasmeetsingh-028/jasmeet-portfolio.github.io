👋 A passionate Data Scientist and recent graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from Bennett University. My journey through academia and research has been driven by a deep curiosity and enthusiasm for Data Science and Machine Learning. 

🔍 I love exploring the realms of data science, machine learning, and computer vision. My experiences have equipped me with the skills to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions. Whether it's working with deep learning models or visualizing intricate datasets, I find joy in uncovering insights and making impactful contributions.

🤝 I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with teams to bring ideas to life. My goal is to continually learn, grow, and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. If you share a similar passion or have exciting opportunities, let's connect and create something amazing together!

🌟 When I'm not immersed in data, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest advancements in AI, or simply enjoying a good book. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations. Let's make a difference with data! 🚀
